## 🔍 Understanding PHP Configuration Settings

PHP configuration settings control various aspects of how PHP operates. Here are some key settings:

### 🧩 Basic Settings

```
- memory_limit: Controls the maximum amount of memory a script can use.

     memory_limit = 128M

- max_execution_time: Sets the maximum time (in seconds) a script is allowed to run.

     max_execution_time = 30

- post_max_size: Defines the maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept.

     post_max_size = 8M
```

### 🔐 Security Settings

```
display_errors: Controls whether errors are displayed to users. This should be set to Off in production environments to avoid exposing sensitive information.

    display_errors = Off

expose_php: Determines whether PHP version is exposed in HTTP headers. It’s often set to Off for security reasons.

    expose_php = Off

```

## 🚨 Configuring Error Reporting and Display Errors

Proper error reporting and handling are crucial for debugging and maintaining your PHP applications.

### 📈 Error Reporting
```
    1. Enable Error Reporting: Set the error_reporting directive to control which errors    are reported.

        error_reporting = E_ALL
     
    This setting reports all types of errors, including notices, warnings, and fatal errors.

    2. Modify at Runtime: You can also set error reporting in your script for testing purposes:

        <?php
            error_reporting(E_ALL);
            ini_set('display_errors', 1);
        ?>
```

###  🛑 Display Errors

- **Display Errors in Development:**
  For development environments, you may want to display errors directly on the page. 
  ```
     display_errors = On
  ``` 
- **Disable Display Errors in Production:**
    For production environments, it's safer to log errors to a file rather than displaying them to users.
   ```
     display_errors = Off
     log_errors = On
     error_log = /path/to/php_error.log
   ```

## 1.3 Writing and Running Your First PHP Script

### 🌟 Embedding PHP in HTML

#### 📜 **Basic PHP Tags**

PHP scripts are embedded within HTML using the following tags:
```php
<?php
// PHP code goes here
?>
```
<li> Opening Tag: <?php — Indicates the start of a PHP script.</li>
<li> Closing Tag: ?> — Marks the end of a PHP script (optional in many cases)</li>

#### 🔖 Short Tags and Their Usage

Short tags offer a more concise way to embed PHP code:

```
<? // PHP code goes here ?>
```

#### 🗂️ PHP Syntax Basics

🅰️ Case Sensitivity

<li><b>Variables:</b> PHP variable names are case-sensitive. For example, $variable and $Variable are different variables.</li>
<li><b>Functions and Keywords:</b> PHP function names and keywords are case-insensitive. For example, `echo`, `Echo`, and `ECHO` are all valid.</li>

# 2. Basic PHP Concepts

## 🧩 2.1 Variables and Data Types

### 📦 2.1.1 Declaring Variables

In PHP, variables are essential for storing and manipulating data. Let’s dive into how to declare and initialize them effectively.

### 🖋️ **Rules for Variable Naming**

When naming variables in PHP, adhere to the following rules:

- **Start with a Dollar Sign**: All PHP variables begin with the dollar sign (`$`).
  ```php
  $variableName;
- **Begin with a Letter or Underscore:**: Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_), but not a number.
  ```php
  $myVariable;     // Valid
  $_myVariable;    // Valid
  $1myVariable;    // Invalid
- **Followed by Letters, Numbers, or Underscores:**: After the initial character, variable names can include letters, numbers, and underscores.
  ```php 
  $variable1;       // Valid
  $variable_name;   // Valid
  $VariableName;    // Valid

- **Case Sensitivity:**: PHP variable names are case-sensitive. $Variable and $variable are different variables.
    ```php
    $Variable = "Hello";
    $variable = "World";

- **No Spaces:**: Spaces are not allowed in variable names. Use underscores or camelCase instead.
  ```php
    $my_variable;      // Valid
    $myVariable;       // Valid

🌟 Initializing Variables

Initialization of variables involves assigning them an initial value. This is crucial for avoiding errors and ensuring that variables have meaningful data from the start.

- **Basic Assignment:**: 
  ```php
    $greeting = "Hello, World!";
- **Multiple Initializations:**: 
  ```php
    $name = "Alice";
    $age = 25;
    $isStudent = true;

    In this example:
        $name is a string.
        $age is an integer.
        $isStudent is a boolean.
- **Dynamic Assignment:**: 
Variables can also be assigned values dynamically based on conditions or computations.
  ```php
    $number = 10;
    $result = $number * 5;  // $result will be 50

### 🎨 Example
Here’s a complete example demonstrating variable declaration and initialization in PHP:

```php
<?php
// Declaring and initializing variables
$firstName = "John";
$lastName = "Doe";
$age = 30;
$isEmployed = true;

// Outputting the values
echo "Name: " . $firstName . " " . $lastName . "<br>";
echo "Age: " . $age . "<br>";
echo "Employed: " . ($isEmployed ? "Yes" : "No");
?>
```
## 📊 2.1.2 PHP Data Types

Understanding PHP data types is crucial for effective programming. PHP supports several data types, which can be categorized into scalar types, compound types, and special types.

### 🔢 Scalar Types

Scalar types represent single values. They are the most basic data types in PHP.

### 1. **String** 💬

- **Definition**: A sequence of characters enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
- **Example**:
  ```php
  $greeting = "Hello, World!";
  ```
- **Features:**
    - **1. Can include letters, numbers, and special characters.**
    - **2. Supports various string operations like concatenation and interpolation.**

### 2. **Integer** 🔢

- **Definition: Whole numbers without any decimal points.**
- **Example:**
    ```php
    $age = 25;
    ```
- **Features:**
    Often used in conditional statements and loops.

### 🗂️ Compound Types

Compound types are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

### **1. Array 🗃️**
- **Definition:** A collection of values indexed by keys.
- **Example:**
  ```php
     $colors = array("Red", "Green", "Blue");
- **Features**
  - Can be indexed (numeric) or associative (key-value pairs).
  - Supports various functions to manipulate and access elements. 

### **2. Object 🧩**
- **Definition:** An instance of a class that can contain properties and methods.
- **Example:**
  ```php
    class Person{
    public $name;
    public function greet() {
        return "Hello, " . $this->name;
    }
  }
  $person = new Person();
  $person->name = "John";
  echo $person->greet();

- **Features**
  - Enables object-oriented programming.
  - Supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### **3.Callable 📞**
- **Definition:** A type that represents a callable function or method.
- **Example:**
  ```php
    function sayHello(){
    return "Hello!";
   }
   $function = "sayHello";
   echo $function(); // Calls sayHello() function

- **Features**
  - Can be a function name, an array with an object and method name, or a closure.
  - Useful for dynamic function calls and callback functions.

### 🔮 Special Types

Special types have unique roles and characteristics.

### **1. NULL 🚫**
- **Definition:** Represents a variable with no value.
- **Example:**
  ```php
    $var = NULL;

- **Features**
  - Often used to signify an absent or undefined value.
  - Checking for NULL can help in conditional logic.

### **2. Resource 🗄️**
- **Definition:** A special variable that holds a reference to an external resource, like a database connection.
- **Example:**
  ```php
    $connection = mysqli_connect("localhost", "user", "password", "database");


- **Features**
  - Typically used for handling file operations, database connections, etc.
  - Cannot be directly manipulated like other data types.

🌈 Conclusion
PHP’s data types are essential for defining and manipulating variables effectively. Scalar types are fundamental for single values, compound types are used for collections and objects, and special types handle unique cases. Understanding these types is key to mastering PHP programming.

##  🎨 ** 2.1.3 Type Juggling and Type Casting in PHP**

PHP, being a loosely typed language, provides flexibility with variable types and how they can be manipulated. This is due to PHP's dynamic type system that automatically converts data types based on the context in which a variable is used. Understanding **Type Juggling** (implicit conversion) and **Type Casting** (explicit conversion) is crucial for writing effective PHP code. Let's explore these concepts in detail!

### 🌀 **Implicit Type Conversion (Type Juggling)**

**Type Juggling** refers to the automatic conversion of data types by PHP. When a variable is used in different contexts, PHP implicitly changes its type to match the required operation.

#### 🔍 **How Implicit Type Conversion Works**

Implicit type conversion occurs in various scenarios:

- **Arithmetic Operations**: When a string that contains numeric data is used in arithmetic operations, PHP converts the string to a number.
  ```php
  $a = "10";  // $a is a string
  $b = $a + 5; // $b is now 15 (integer)

    In this example, the string "10" is converted to an integer 10 to perform the addition.
- **String Concatenation:**:When using the . operator to concatenate strings, numbers are converted to strings.
    ```php
    $x = 10;
    $y = " apples";
    echo $x . $y; // Output: "10 apples"

    Here, the integer 10 is converted to the string "10" for concatenation.
- **Boolean Context:**:Variables are converted to boolean values when evaluated in conditions.
    ```php
    $var = "0";
    if ($var) {
        echo "This will not print.";  // "0" is treated as false
    }


    In this example, the string "0" is treated as false in the conditional statement.

### 📝 Examples of Type Juggling in Different Contexts

- **Array and String Context:**
  ```php
     $array = [1, 2, 3];
     $string = "Array: " . $array; // Warning: Array to string conversion
     echo $string; // Output: "Array: Array"
   ```
    When attempting to concatenate an array with a string, PHP converts the array to the string "Array".
- **Comparison Context:**
  ```php
     $x = 0;
     $y = "hello";
     if ($x == $y) {
       echo "Equal"; // This prints because both are considered false
     }
   ```
     In loose comparisons (==), PHP converts both 0 and "hello" to boolean false.

### 🎯 Explicit Type Casting

Explicit **Type Casting** is a method to manually convert a variable from one type to another. This ensures that a variable is of a specific type before proceeding with an operation, providing more control over data types.

#### 🚀 How to Perform Explicit Type Casting

To explicitly cast a variable to a different type, prefix the variable with the desired type in parentheses:

- **(int)** or **(integer)**: Converts to an integer.
- **(bool)** or **(boolean)**: Converts to a boolean.
- **(float)** or **(double)** or **(real)**: Converts to a floating-point number.
- **(string)**: Converts to a string.
- **(array)**: Converts to an array.
- **(object)**: Converts to an object.

#### 📝 Examples of Type Casting

- **Casting a String to an Integer:**
  ```php
     $str = "42.3";
     $num = (int) $str;  // $num becomes 42 (integer)
     echo $num; // Output: 42
   ```
    The string "42.3" is converted to the integer 42, truncating the decimal part.
- **Casting a Float to a Boolean:**
  ```php
     $val = 0.0;
     $bool = (bool) $val;  // $bool is false
     echo $bool ? 'True' : 'False'; // Output: False
   ```
   A float value of 0.0 is cast to false as a boolean.
- **Casting an Integer to a String:**
  ```php
     $number = 123;
     $string = (string) $number;  // $string becomes "123"
     echo $string; // Output: "123"

## 🧰 Understanding gettype() and settype() Functions

PHP provides built-in functions gettype() and settype() for inspecting and manipulating variable types.

### 📊 gettype() Function

The **gettype()** function returns the type of a variable as a string. This is useful for debugging and type-checking purposes.

**Example Usage of gettype():**
```php
$var = 3.14;
echo gettype($var);  // Output: double
```
In this example, gettype($var) returns double since $var is a floating-point number.

### 🛠️ settype() Function
The settype() function changes the type of a variable. Unlike casting, which does not modify the original variable, settype() directly alters the variable's type.
**Example Usage of settype():**
```php
$var = "123";
settype($var, "integer");  // $var is now an integer (123)
echo $var; // Output: 123
```
Here, the variable $var was originally a string "123" but was changed to an integer using settype().

### 💡 Practical Examples

- **Using gettype():**
```php
$data = false;
echo "The type of data is: " . gettype($data);  // Output: The type of data is: boolean
```
This example uses gettype() to determine that $data is a boolean.

- **Using settype():**
```php
$num = "45.67";
settype($num, "float");  // $num is now a float
echo gettype($num);  // Output: double
echo $num; // Output: 45.67
```

## 🎯 **Operators in PHP**

Operators are essential tools in PHP for performing various operations. Understanding these operators is crucial for writing efficient and effective PHP code. Let's explore the different types of operators in PHP!

---

## ➕ **Arithmetic Operators**

Arithmetic operators are used for performing mathematical calculations. 

| **Operator** | **Description**        | **Example**         |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| `+`          | Addition               | `$a + $b`           |
| `-`          | Subtraction            | `$a - $b`           |
| `*`          | Multiplication         | `$a * $b`           |
| `/`          | Division               | `$a / $b`           |
| `%`          | Modulus (remainder)    | `$a % $b`           |

### 📊 **Understanding Operator Precedence**

Operator precedence determines how operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

For example:  
```php
$result = 5 + 3 * 2;  // Output: 11 (Multiplication first, then addition)
```
##  📥 Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

| **Operator**  | **Description**           | **Example**                   |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `=`           | Assignment                |`$x = 5`                       |
| `+=`          | Addition Assignment       |`$x += 3 (same as $x = $x + 3)`|
| `-=`          | Subtraction  Assignment   |`$x -= 3 (same as $x = $x-3)`  |
| `*=`          | Multiplication  Assignment|`$x *= 3 (same as $x = $x * 3)`|
| `/=`          | Division Assignment       |`$x /= 3 (same as $x = $x / 3)`|

## 🔍 Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

| **Operator**  | **Description**                 | **Example**           |
|---------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|
|==	            |Equal	                          |5 == 5 (true)          |
|!=	            |Not equal	                      |5 != 3 (true)          |
|>	            |Greater than	                    |5 > 3 (true)           |
|<	            |Less than	                      |3 < 5 (true)           |
|>=	            |Greater than or equal to	        |5 >= 5 (true)          |
|<=	            |Less than or equal to	          |3 <= 5 (true)          |
|===	          |Identical (Equal and same type)  |5 === "5" (false)      |
|!==	          |Not identical	                  |5 !== "5" (true)       |
|??	            |Null coalescing	                |$x = $y ?? 'default'   |

## 🔗 Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

| **Operator**  | **Description**                 | **Example**             |
|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
|`&&`           |Logical AND	                    |(5 > 3) && (2 < 4) (true)|
|`\|\|`         |Logical OR	                      |5 \|\| 3 (true)          |
|`!`            |Logical NOT	                    |!(5 > 3) (false)         |

### 💡 Short-circuit Evaluation

Logical operators use short-circuit evaluation, which means the second operand is not evaluated if the result can already be determined from the first operand.

```
$result = (5 > 3) && ($x = 2); // If the first expression is false, $x is never set
```

## 📝 String Operators

String operators are used to manipulate and concatenate strings.

| **Operator**  | **Description**         | **Example**                                               |
|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|`.`            |Concatenation            |'Hello' . ' World!' = 'Hello World!'                       |
|`.=`           |Concatenation Assignment |$txt = 'Hello'; $txt .= ' World!'; ($txt is 'Hello World!')|
|

  - Understanding and using alternative syntax for templating


## 🧩 Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are fundamental for decision-making in programming. They allow you to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions.

### 1. Conditional Operator: `expr1 ? expr2 : expr3`

The **conditional operator** (ternary operator) is a concise way to perform conditional logic. It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false.

**Syntax:**
```php
$result = (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
```
Example:
```php
$age = 18;
$status = ($age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
echo $status; // Output: Adult
```
Flow Chart:<br/>
   ![alt text](images/image-16.png)

Example :

#### Scenario: Determine if a user is eligible for a senior citizen discount.

```php
$age = 65;
$discount = ($age >= 60) ? "Eligible for discount" : "Not eligible for discount";
echo $discount; // Output: Eligible for discount
```
### 2. if
PHP if statement allows conditional execution of code. It is executed if condition is true.

If statement is used to executes the block of code exist inside the if statement only if the specified condition is true.

Syntax :

```php
if(condition){  
//code to be executed  
}  
```
Flowchart:<br/>
![alt text](images/image-13.png)

Example :

```php
  <?php  
$num=12;  
if($num<100){  
echo "$num is less than 100";  
}  
?> 
``` 
### 3. if-else 

The if-else statement evaluates a condition and executes one block of code if the condition is true, and another block if it is false. Nesting if-else allows for more complex decision-making.

Syntax:

```php
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
```
Flow Chart:<br/>

![alt text](images/image-11.png)


Example-01:

```php
$temperature = 30;

if ($temperature > 25) {
    echo "It's hot outside!";
} else {
    echo "It's cool outside.";
}

```
Example-02:

#### Scenario: Determine the discount based on a purchase amount.

```php
$purchaseAmount = 150;

if ($purchaseAmount > 100) {
    $discount = 20;
} else {
    $discount = 5;
}

echo "Discount: $discount%";
```

### 4. `elseif` vs. `else if`

**elseif** and **else if** are functionally similar but elseif is generally preferred for its readability and compactness.

Syntax:
```php
if (condition1) {
    // code
} elseif (condition2) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}
```
Flowchart :

![alt text](images/image-12.png)


Example-01:

```php
$grade = 85;

if ($grade >= 90) {
    echo "Grade A";
} elseif ($grade >= 80) {
    echo "Grade B";
} elseif ($grade >= 70) {
    echo "Grade C";
} else {
    echo "Grade D";
}
```

Example-02 :

#### Scenario: Assign a performance rating based on sales figures.

```php
$sales = 5000;

if ($sales >= 10000) {
    $rating = "Excellent";
} elseif ($sales >= 5000) {
    $rating = "Good";
} elseif ($sales >= 2000) {
    $rating = "Average";
} else {
    $rating = "Needs Improvement";
}

echo "Performance: $rating";

```

### 5. `nested if`

The nested if statement contains the if block inside another if block. The inner if statement executes only when specified condition in outer if statement is true.

Syntax:

```php
if (condition) {    
//code to be executed if condition is true   
if (condition) {    
//code to be executed if condition is true    
}    
}   
```
Flowchart: <br/>

![alt text](images/image-14.png)

Example:

```php
<?php  
    $age = 23;  
    $nationality = "Indian";  
    //applying conditions on nationality and age  
    if ($nationality == "Indian")  
    {  
        if ($age >= 18) {  
            echo "Eligible to give vote";  
        }  
        else {    
            echo "Not eligible to give vote";  
        }  
    }  
?>  
```

### 6. Switch-case

The switch-case  is used to execute one block of code among multiple options. It’s ideal when dealing with multiple values of a single variable.

Syntax:

```php
switch (variable) {
    case value1:
        // code
        break;
    case value2:
        // code
        break;
    default:
        // code
}
```
Example:

```php
$day = 'Tuesday';

switch ($day) {
    case 'Monday':
        echo "Start of the week.";
        break;
    case 'Tuesday':
        echo "Second day of the week.";
        break;
    case 'Friday':
        echo "Almost weekend!";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Mid-week or weekend.";
}
```

Flow Chart:

![alt text](images/image-15.png)

Example-01:

Scenario: Determine the type of a beverage based on its code.

```php
$beverageCode = 'T';

switch ($beverageCode) {
    case 'C':
        echo "Coffee";
        break;
    case 'T':
        echo "Tea";
        break;
    case 'J':
        echo "Juice";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Unknown beverage";
}
```

Example-02 :

Scenario: Determine the day of the week and respond accordingly.

```php
$dayOfWeek = 'Wednesday';

switch ($dayOfWeek) {
    case 'Monday':
        echo "Meeting day.";
        break;
    case 'Wednesday':
        echo "Work on project.";
        break;
    case 'Friday':
        echo "Prepare for the weekend.";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Regular working day.";
}
```

## 🔄 Looping Structures

Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. Here’s a look at the different looping structures in PHP.

### 1. while Loop

 **while Loop:** Executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.

 **Syntax:**

 ```php
 while (condition) {
    // code to execute
}
```
**Example:**
```php
$i = 1;
while ($i <= 5) {
    echo $i++;
}
```

### do-while Loop

**do-while Loop:** Executes a block of code at least once before checking the condition.

**Syntax:**
```php
do {
    // code to execute
} while (condition);
```
**Example-01:**
```php
$i = 1;
do {
    echo $i++;
} while ($i <= 5);

```

**Example-02:**

Scenario: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using while and do-while loops.

```php
// while loop
$i = 1;
while ($i <= 5) {
    echo $i++;
}

// do-while loop
$i = 1;
do {
    echo $i++;
} while ($i <= 5);
```

### for Loop 

for Loop: Used for a known number of iterations.

**Syntax:**
```php
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // code to execute
}
```
**Example:**
```php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    echo $i;
}
```
### foreach Loop: 

    foreach Loop Specifically designed for iterating over arrays.

**Syntax:**
```php
foreach (array as $value) {
    // code to execute
}
```
**Example-01:**
```php
$colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
foreach ($colors as $color) {
    echo $color;
}
```
**Example-02:**
**Scenario:** Iterate through an array of user names and display them.
```php
$userNames = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];

foreach ($userNames as $name) {
    echo "Hello, $name!";
}
```

## Understanding Loop Control: break and continue

break exits the loop prematurely, while continue skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds with the next one.

### Syntax for break:

```php
while (condition) {
    if (break_condition) {
        break;
    }
    // code
}
```
### Syntax for continue:

```php
while (condition) {
    if (continue_condition) {
        continue;
    }
    // code
}
```
### Example

```php
// break example
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    if ($i == 3) {
        break;
    }
    echo $i; // Output: 1 2
}

// continue example
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    if ($i == 3) {
        continue;
    }
    echo $i; // Output: 1 2 4 5
}
```
#### Scenario: Find the first even number greater than 5 and stop the loop.

```php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    if ($i % 2 == 0 && $i > 5) {
        echo $i;
        break;
    }
}
```

## 📝 Alternative Syntax for Control Structures

Alternative syntax is useful when mixing PHP with HTML, particularly in templates. It enhances readability and separates PHP code from HTML.

**Syntax for if-else:**
```php
  <?php if (condition): ?>
      <!-- HTML code here -->
  <?php else: ?>
      <!-- Alternative HTML code here -->
  <?php endif; ?>
```

**Syntax for foreach:**
```php
  <?php foreach ($array as $item): ?>
      <!-- HTML code here -->
  <?php endforeach; ?>
```
**Example-01:**
```php
  <?php if ($isLoggedIn): ?>
      <p>Welcome, <?= $username ?>!</p>
  <?php else: ?>
      <p>Please <a href="login.php">log in</a>.</p>
  <?php endif; ?>
```
**Example-02:**

**Scenario:** Display user profile information if logged in, otherwise prompt for login.

```php
  <?php
  $isLoggedIn = true;
  $username = 'JohnDoe';
  ?>

  <?php if ($isLoggedIn): ?>
      <h1>Hello, <?= $username ?>!</h1>
      <p>Welcome back to your dashboard.</p>
  <?php else: ?>
      <p>Please <a href="login.php">log in</a> to continue.</p>
  <?php endif; ?>
```

## 🚀 2.4 Functions

Functions are reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code into logical blocks, making it more readable, maintainable, and reusable.

### 📝 Defining Functions

#### 📌 Function Declaration and Calling

A **function** is defined using the `function` keyword followed by the function name and a set of parentheses `()`. Function names should be meaningful, indicating the task they perform.

**Syntax:**
```php
function functionName() {
    // Code to be executed
}
```
**Calling a Function:**

```php
functionName(); // This executes the code inside the function
```
**Example:**
```php
function sayHello() {
    echo "Hello, World!";
}

sayHello(); // Output: Hello, World!
```

### 📌 Function Arguments and Return Values

Functions can take arguments (also known as parameters) to work with data and return values after processing them.

**Syntax:**
```php
  function functionName($arg1, $arg2) {
      // Code to process arguments
      return $result; // Returns a value
  }
```
**Example-01:**
```php
  function add($a, $b) {
      return $a + $b;
  }

  echo add(3, 5); // Output: 8
```
**Example-02:**

**Scenario:** Calculate the area of a rectangle using a function.

```php
  function calculateArea($length, $width) {
      return $length * $width;
  }

  echo calculateArea(5, 10); // Output: 50
```
### 🔍 Advanced Function Concepts

#### 📌 Default Argument Values

You can define default values for function arguments. If no value is passed when the function is called, the default value is used.

**Syntax:**
```php
  function greet($name = "Guest") {
      echo "Hello, $name!";
  }

  greet(); // Output: Hello, Guest!
  greet("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```
#### 📌 Variable-Length Argument Lists using ...$args

PHP allows you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function using the ... operator.

**Syntax:**
```php
  function sum(...$numbers) {
      $total = 0;
      foreach ($numbers as $number) {
          $total += $number;
      }
      return $total;
  }

  echo sum(1, 2, 3, 4); // Output: 10
```
**Example:**

**Scenario:** Create a function to concatenate multiple strings.
```php
  function concatenateStrings(...$strings) {
      return implode(" ", $strings);
  }

  echo concatenateStrings("PHP", "is", "fun!"); // Output: PHP is fun!
```

#### 📌 Understanding Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference

By default, PHP passes arguments by value, meaning the original variable is not modified. You can pass by reference using the & symbol to allow the function to modify the original variable.

**Pass by Value Example:**
```php
  function addOne($number) {
      $number++;
  }

  $num = 5;
  addOne($num);
  echo $num; // Output: 5
```

#### Pass by Reference Example:

```php
function addOne(&$number) {
    $number++;
}

$num = 5;
addOne($num);
echo $num; // Output: 6
```

### 🌐 Scope and Lifetime of Variables

#### 📌 Local, Global, and Static Scope

**Local Variables:** Defined inside a function and not accessible outside.

**Global Variables:** Defined outside any function and accessible globally. Use the global keyword to access them inside functions.

**Static Variables:** Retain their value between function calls.

**Examples:**
```php
  // Global scope
  $globalVar = "I am global";

  function testScope() {
      // Local scope
      $localVar = "I am local";
      
      global $globalVar;
      echo $globalVar; // Output: I am global
  }

  testScope();
  echo $localVar; // Error: Undefined variable $localVar

  function staticVarExample() {
      static $count = 0;
      $count++;
      echo $count;
  }

  staticVarExample(); // Output: 1
  staticVarExample(); // Output: 2
```
#### 📌 Superglobals: $_GET, $_POST, $_SESSION, etc.

Superglobals are built-in variables in PHP that are always accessible, regardless of scope. They include $_GET, $_POST, $_SESSION, $_COOKIE, and more, often used to handle user input and session management.

**Example:**

```php
    // Using $_GET to capture query string parameters
    echo $_GET['username'];

    // Using $_POST to capture form data
    echo $_POST['email'];

    // Using $_SESSION to store session data
    session_start();
    $_SESSION['user'] = "JohnDoe";
    echo $_SESSION['user']; // Output: JohnDoe
```

### 🔒 Anonymous Functions and Closures

#### 📌 Defining and Using Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions (also called closures) are functions without a name. They are often used as callback functions or when you need a quick, one-time-use function.

**Syntax:**
```php
  $greet = function($name) {
      echo "Hello, $name!";
  };

  $greet("World"); // Output: Hello, World!
```
#### 📌 Binding Variables to Closures using use

You can bind variables from the parent scope to an anonymous function using the use keyword.

**Syntax:**
```php
  $message = "Hello";

  $example = function($name) use ($message) {
      echo "$message, $name!";
  };

  $example("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```
**Example:**

**Scenario:** Create a function to generate a personalized greeting message using closures.

```php
  function createGreeting($greeting) {
      return function($name) use ($greeting) {
          return "$greeting, $name!";
      };
  }

  $helloGreeting = createGreeting("Hello");
  echo $helloGreeting("John"); // Output: Hello, John!

  $goodbyeGreeting = createGreeting("Goodbye");
  echo $goodbyeGreeting("John"); // Output: Goodbye, John!
```



# 3. 📝 Working with Data in PHP

## 📊 3.1 Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures in PHP that allow you to store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays can hold various data types, including numbers, strings, and even other arrays. Let's explore the different types of arrays and the array functions available in PHP.

### 📌 Types of Arrays

1. **Indexed Arrays**: Arrays with numeric indices.
2. **Associative Arrays**: Arrays with named keys.
3. **Multidimensional Arrays**: Arrays containing one or more arrays.

#### 1. Indexed Arrays: Numeric Indices

Indexed arrays use numeric indices starting from 0 by default. These are useful for storing a list of items.

**Syntax:**
```php
  $fruits = array("Apple", "Banana", "Orange");
  // OR using short syntax
  $fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
```
**Example:**
```php
  $colors = ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue'];
  echo $colors[0]; // Output: Red
```

**Case Study:** 

**Scenario:** Store a list of fruits and display each one.
```php
$fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
foreach ($fruits as $fruit) {
    echo $fruit . "<br>";
}
```
#### 2. Associative Arrays: Named Keys

Associative arrays use named keys that you assign to them. This type of array is useful when you want to store key-value pairs.

**Syntax:**
```php
  $person = array("name" => "John", "age" => 30, "city" => "New York");
  // OR using short syntax
  $person = ["name" => "John", "age" => 30, "city" => "New York"];
```
**Case Study:**

**Scenario:** Store and display information about a person.
```php
  $person = ["name" => "John", "age" => 30, "city" => "New York"];
  echo "Name: " . $person["name"] . "<br>";
  echo "Age: " . $person["age"] . "<br>";
  echo "City: " . $person["city"];
```
#### 3. Multidimensional Arrays: Arrays of Arrays
Multidimensional arrays contain other arrays as their elements. This is useful for storing complex data structures.

**Syntax:**

```php
    $matrix = array(
        array(1, 2, 3),
        array(4, 5, 6),
        array(7, 8, 9)
    );

    $departments = [
        'HR' => ['Alice', 'Bob'],
        'IT' => ['Charlie', 'Dave']
    ];

    $students = array(
    array("John", 18, "A"),
    array("Alice", 17, "B"),
    array("Bob", 19, "A")
    );
    // OR using short syntax
    $students = [
        ["John", 18, "A"],
        ["Alice", 17, "B"],
        ["Bob", 19, "A"]
    ];
```

**Example:** Store and display information about multiple students.

```php
 $students = [
    ["John", 18, "A"],
    ["Alice", 17, "B"],
    ["Bob", 19, "A"]
];

foreach ($students as $student) {
    echo "Name: " . $student[0] . ", Age: " . $student[1] . ", Grade: " . $student[2] . "<br>";
}
```
### ⚙️ Array Functions

PHP provides a variety of functions to manipulate arrays. Here’s a look at some of the most commonly used ones.

#### 1. Creating Arrays: array(), Short Array Syntax []
- **array():** Creates an array.
- Short array syntax []: A shorthand way to create an array.

- **Example:**
  ```php
     $animals = array('Cat', 'Dog', 'Elephant'); // Using array()
     $cars = ['Toyota', 'Honda', 'Ford']; // Using short syntax
  ```
- **Case Study:** Scenario: Create an array of colors and print each color.
  ```php
    $colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];
    foreach ($colors as $color) {
        echo $color . "<br>";
    }
  ```
#### 2. Adding/Removing Elements : array_push(), array_pop(), array_shift(), array_unshift()
- **array_push():** Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
- **array_pop():** Removes the last element of an array.
- **array_shift():** Removes the first element of an array.
- **array_unshift():** Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.

- **Syntax:**
  ```php
      array_push($array, $value1, $value2, ...);
      array_pop($array);
      array_shift($array);
      array_unshift($array, $value1, $value2, ...);
  ```
- **Example:**
  ```php
    $numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    array_push($numbers, 4); // $numbers is now [1, 2, 3, 4]
    array_pop($numbers); // $numbers is now [1, 2, 3]

    array_shift($numbers); // $numbers is now [2, 3]
    array_unshift($numbers, 0); // $numbers is now [0, 2, 3]
  ```

- **Case Study:**

  **Scenario:** Manage a list of colors by adding and removing elements.
  ```php
     $colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];

    // Adding elements
    array_push($colors, "Yellow");
    array_unshift($colors, "Pink");

    // Removing elements
    array_pop($colors);
    array_shift($colors);

    foreach ($colors as $color) {
        echo $color . "<br>";
    }
  ```

#### 3. Array Traversal : foreach, array_map()

- **foreach:** Loops through an array.
- **array_map():** Applies a callback function to each element of an array.
- **Syntax:**
  ```php
     foreach ($array as $value) {
       // code to execute
    }
    $newArray = array_map('callbackFunction', $array);
  ```
- **Example:** 
  ```php
     $colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

     foreach ($colors as $color) {
          echo $color;
     }

    $numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    $squares = array_map(fn($n) => $n * $n, $numbers); // [1, 4, 9]
  ``` 
- **Case Study:** 
  **Scenario:** Convert a list of prices to include tax.
  ```php
    $prices = [100, 200, 300];
    $pricesWithTax = array_map(function($price) {
       return $price * 1.2;
    }, $prices);
  ```
  **Scenario:** Traverse an array of numbers and double each value using array_map().
  ```php
   $numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  // Traversal using foreach
  foreach ($numbers as $number) {
      echo $number . "<br>";
  }

  // Doubling each value using array_map
  $doubled = array_map(function($n) {
      return $n * 2;
  }, $numbers);

  foreach ($doubled as $double) {
      echo $double . "<br>";
  }
  ```
#### 4. Array Search Functions : in_array(), array_search(), array_key_exists()
 
- **in_array():** Checks if a value exists in an array.
- **array_search():** Searches the array for a value and returns the first corresponding key if successful.
- **array_key_exists():**  Checks if the specified key exists in the array.
- **Syntax:**
  ```php
     if (in_array("value", $array)) {
    // code
  }

  $key = array_search("value", $array);

  if (array_key_exists("key", $array)) {
    // code
  }
  ```
- **Example:**

  ```php
    $fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

    if (in_array('banana', $fruits)) {
        echo 'Banana is in the list!';
    }

    $key = array_search('cherry', $fruits); // $key is 2

    $user = ['username' => 'johndoe'];
    if (array_key_exists('username', $user)) {
        echo 'User exists!';
    }
  ```

- **Case Study:**
  
  **Scenario:** Check if a product is in stock.

  ```php
    $products = ['laptop', 'mouse', 'keyboard'];

    if (in_array('mouse', $products)) {
        echo 'Mouse is available!';
    } else {
        echo 'Mouse is out of stock!';
    }
  ```

  **Scenario:** Search for a specific fruit in an array and check if it exists.

  ```php
   $fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];

  // in_array example
  if (in_array("Banana", $fruits)) {
    echo "Banana is in the array.<br>";
  }

  // array_search example
  $key = array_search("Orange", $fruits);
  if ($key !== false) {
    echo "Orange is at index: " . $key . "<br>";
  }

  // array_key_exists example
  if (array_key_exists(0, $fruits)) {
    echo "Index 0 exists in the array and contains: " . $fruits[0];
  }
  ```

#### 5. Array Sorting Functions:sort(), asort(), ksort(), usort()
- **sort():** Sorts an indexed array in ascending order.
- **asort():** Sorts an associative array in ascending order, according to the value.
- **ksort():** Sorts an associative array in ascending order, according to the key.
- **usort():** Sorts an array by values using a user-defined comparison function.

  ksort($array);
  usort($array, 'comparisonFunction');

  ```
- **Example:** 
  ```php
  $numbers = [4, 2, 8, 6];
  sort($numbers); // $numbers is now [2, 4, 6, 8]

  $ages = ['Peter' => 35, 'John' => 25, 'Anna' => 45];
  asort($ages); // $ages is now ['John' => 25, 'Peter' => 35, 'Anna' => 45]
  ksort($ages); // $ages is now ['Anna' => 45, 'John' => 25, 'Peter' => 35]

  $products = [
      ['name' => 'Laptop', 'price' => 1000],
      ['name' => 'Tablet', 'price' => 500]
  ];
  usort($products, function($a, $b) {
      return $a['price'] <=> $b['price'];
  });

  ```
- **Case Study:** 

  **Scenario:** Sort a list of employees by their age.

  ```php
    $employees = [
     ['name' => 'John', 'age' => 28],
     ['name' => 'Jane', 'age' => 32],
     ['name' => 'Dave', 'age' => 25]
    ];

    usort($employees, function($a, $b) {
    return $a['age'] <=> $b['age'];
    });
  ```

## 📜 3.2 Strings in PHP

Strings are one of the most commonly used data types in PHP. This guide provides a detailed exploration of string creation, formatting, functions, and encoding.

### 🏗️ String Creation and Formatting

#### 1. Single Quotes vs. Double Quotes

In PHP, strings can be defined using either single quotes or double quotes. The choice affects how the string is processed.

**Single Quotes (`'`):**  
- Strings enclosed in single quotes are treated as literal strings.  
- Variables inside single quotes are not evaluated.  
- Special characters like `\n` are not parsed.

**Syntax:**
```php
$string = 'This is a string in single quotes.';
```
**Example:**
```php
$name = 'John';
echo 'Hello, $name'; // Output: Hello, $name
```

**Double Quotes ("):**  
- Strings enclosed in double quotes allow variable interpolation and escape sequences. 
- Variables inside double quotes are evaluated.
- Special characters like \n are parsed.

**Syntax:**
```php
$string = "This is a string in double quotes.";
```
**Example:**
```php
$name = 'John';
echo "Hello, $name"; // Output: Hello, John
```

**Case Study:** 

**Scenario:** You need to construct a greeting message using a user's name.

```php
  $userName = "Alice";
  echo 'Welcome, ' . $userName . '!'; // Output: Welcome, Alice!
  echo "Welcome, $userName!"; // Output: Welcome, Alice!
```
#### 2. Heredoc and Nowdoc Syntax

**Heredoc:**
Heredoc provides a way to define large blocks of text. It behaves like double-quoted strings but is more convenient for multi-line text.

**Syntax:**
```php
$heredoc = <<<EOT
This is a heredoc string.
It supports variables like $variable and escape sequences.
EOT;
```
**Example:**
```php
$name = 'Bob';
$heredoc = <<<EOT
Hello, $name!
Welcome to the Heredoc example.
EOT;

echo $heredoc;
// Output:
// Hello, Bob!
// Welcome to the Heredoc example.
```
**Nowdoc:**
Nowdoc is similar to Heredoc but behaves like single-quoted strings. It does not parse variables or escape sequences.

**Syntax:**
```php
$nowdoc = <<<'EOT'
This is a nowdoc string.
Variables like $variable are not parsed.
EOT;
```
**Example:**

```php
  $nowdoc = <<<'EOT'
  Hello, $name!
  This is a Nowdoc example.
  EOT;

  echo $nowdoc;
  // Output:
  // Hello, $name!
  // This is a Nowdoc example.
```

## 🛠️ String Functions

### 1. Finding and Extracting Substrings

**a. strlen()**
Returns the length of a string.

**Syntax:**
```php
$length = strlen($string);
```
**Example:**
```php
echo strlen("Hello, World!"); // Output: 13
```

**b. strpos()**
Finds the position of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

**Syntax:**
```php
$position = strpos($string, $substring);
```
**Example:**
```php
$position = strpos("Hello, World!", "World");
echo $position; // Output: 7
```
**c. substr()**
Returns a portion of a string.

**Syntax:**
```php
$substring = substr($string, $start, $length);
```
**Example:**
```php
$substring = substr("Hello, World!", 7, 5);
echo $substring; // Output: World
```

**Case Study:**

**Scenario:** Extract the domain name from a URL.
```php
  $url = "https://www.example.com/path";
  $start = strpos($url, "www.") + 4;
  $length = strpos($url, "/", $start) - $start;
  $domain = substr($url, $start, $length);
  echo $domain; // Output: example.com
```

#### 2. Modifying Strings

**a. str_replace()**
Replaces all occurrences of a search string with a replacement string.

**Syntax:**
```php
$newString = str_replace($search, $replace, $subject);
```
**Example:**
```php
echo str_replace("World", "PHP", "Hello, World!"); // Output: Hello, PHP!
```

**b. strtolower()**
Converts a string to lowercase.

**Syntax:**
```php
$lowercase = strtolower($string);
```
**Example:**
```php
echo strtolower("HELLO, WORLD!"); // Output: hello, world!
```

**c. strtoupper()**
Converts a string to uppercase.

**Syntax:**
```php
$uppercase = strtoupper($string);
```
**Example:**
```php
echo strtoupper("hello, world!"); // Output: HELLO, WORLD!
```

**d. ucfirst()**
Capitalizes the first character of a string.
**Syntax:**
```php
$capitalized = ucfirst($string);
```
**Example:**
```php
echo ucfirst("hello, world!"); // Output: Hello, world!
```
**Case Study:**
**Scenario:** Clean up and format user input for display.
```php
$userInput = "   HeLLo, WoRLD!  ";
$cleanInput = trim($userInput); // Remove extra spaces
$formattedInput = ucfirst(strtolower($cleanInput)); // Capitalize first letter
echo $formattedInput; // Output: Hello, world!
```
