  Problem : Calculate Compound Interest
  Suppose you invest $1000 at an annual interest rate of 5% compounded annually.
  Write a PHP program to calculate the amount after 10 years.
  Hint: Use the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
  where:
   A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
   P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
   r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
   n = the number of times that interest is compounded per unit t
   t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years
