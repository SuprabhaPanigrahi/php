/*
 * Problem 14: Longest Collatz sequence
 * The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
 * n → n/2 (n is even)
 * n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
 * Write a program to find the number of steps it takes to reach 1 for a given positive integer n.
 * Example: If n = 6, the sequence is 6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1. It takes 8 steps to reach 1.
 * The program should output the number of steps for the input number n.
 * Input: A positive integer n.
 * Output: The number of steps to reach 1.
