  Problem : Write a PHP program to create a function which will reverse  a number and return it.
  Note: The function should take an integer as input and return the reversed integer. and It will handle negative numbers as well. The reversed number should maintain the negative sign if the input number is negative. and The function shlould modify the argument passed by reference.
