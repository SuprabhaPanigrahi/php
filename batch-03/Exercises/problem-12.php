 * Problem: Discount On Sales
 * In Dewali Sale , a shop is giving discount on the sales of items as per the following rules:
 * If the cost of purchased items is more than 1000 then a discount of 10% is given on the total cost.
 * If the cost of purchased items is more than 500 but less than or equal to 1000 then a discount of 5% is given on the total cost.
 * If the cost of purchased items is less than or equal to 500 then no discount is given.
 * Write a program to accept the cost of purchased items and calculate the discount and net amount to be paid by the customer.
