A "jungle story" can refer to a variety of narratives, 
including classic fables about animal friendships and lessons (like the mouse and the lion or the jackal and the lion), 
the famous story of Mowgli from The Jungle Book, and the more serious Upton Sinclair novel, 
The Jungle, which exposed the conditions in Chicago's meatpacking plants. 
It can also refer to modern adventure films, like the 2017 biographical drama Jungle about Yossi Ghinsberg's 
journey into the Amazon rainforest.
